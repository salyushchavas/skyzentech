 * Five-stage hiring funnel with stage-to-stage conversion rates. Same stage
 * bands the operations dashboard uses, but enriched with rate calculations
 * so leadership can spot the leakiest band at a glance.
 *
 * Rates are nullable when the denominator is zero (we don't fake a 0% rate
 * for "no candidates yet" — the frontend renders an em-dash).
