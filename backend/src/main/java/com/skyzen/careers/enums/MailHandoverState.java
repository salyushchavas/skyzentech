 *   <li>{@code PENDING_ACTIVATION} — ERM has assigned a company mailbox

 *       yet. Notifications still go to their personal Gmail.</li>
 *   <li>{@code ACTIVATED} — the user has activated their company mailbox.
 *       All subsequent notifications land in their internal inbox; the
 *       login email may have been swapped to the company address and the
 *       original personal Gmail moved to {@code users.personal_email}.</li>
