/**
 * Role taxonomy for the Skyzen Careers platform.
 *
 * <p>Seven roles drive every dashboard. Per-role functionality is layered in
 * dedicated prompts; this enum is the canonical source of truth for both the
 * database string and the Spring Security authority suffix
 * ({@code ROLE_<name>}).</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #INTERN} — applies for jobs, gets hired, runs projects,
 *       submits timesheets. One role covers pre- and post-hire candidate
 *       lifecycle.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #TRAINER} — assigns projects, conducts sessions, marks
 *       project complete (first sign-off).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #EVALUATOR} — runs monthly + final evaluations and the
 *       separate I-983 evaluations for F-1 STEM OPT interns. Auto-linked
 *       at offer-sign from {@code DEFAULT_EVALUATOR_EMAIL} (Phase 8.6.4).
 *       Single Evaluator org-wide per the locked Phase 0 design.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #REPORTING_MANAGER} — post-trainer review session, approves
 *       timesheets (second sign-off).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #MANAGER} — monitors ERM's work and the application pipeline.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #ERM} — shortlisting, onboarding, all pre-hire operations.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #SUPER_ADMIN} — owner / god-mode oversight.</li>
 * </ul>
