 * <p><b>Bucketing rule:</b> a work-week belongs WHOLLY to the month
 * containing its Monday. Weeks are never split across two months. So a
 * Mon–Fri week of 2026-06-29 .. 2026-07-03 is a JUNE week — all five
 * weekdays appear in June's list and none of them appear in July.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is the same rule applied by the
 * {@code TIMESHEET_DUE} scheduler (write-side: {@code week_start}
 * Monday determines the period), so read-side and write-side agree by
 * construction and existing rows need no migration.</p>
 *
 * <p>Pure functions; no Spring stereotype.</p>
