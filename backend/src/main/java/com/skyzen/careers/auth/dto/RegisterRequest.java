/**
 * Approach 1 — signup is reduced to the four legal-essentials. Every
 * remaining intake field (phone, school/degree/graduationYear/skillset,
 * work-authorization attestation, preferred name, DOB, resume) is collected
 * on the post-signup profile editor at /careers/intern/profile/complete,
 * and the apply endpoint guards on the same derived check
 * (ProfileCompletionService) so the contract holds.
 *
 * <p>{@code fullName} is the user's display name (User row). {@code
 * legalName} mirrors it on the Candidate row at signup so the compliance
 * flows that key off legalName don't see a null — the editor can split
 * them later if the intern types a different legal vs. preferred name.</p>
 *
 * <p>Older clients sending the dropped fields are unaffected: Jackson
 * silently ignores unknown JSON properties under Spring's default
 * configuration, so the previous 12-field POST still succeeds and the
 * extras are just dropped.</p>
 *
 * <p>Legal: {@code acceptedTos} must be true at submit — proof of consent
 * is stamped on the user (tos_accepted_at + tos_version) by AuthService.</p>
