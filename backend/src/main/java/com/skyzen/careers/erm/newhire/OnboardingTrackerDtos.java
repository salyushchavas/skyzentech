/**
 * Wire shapes for the ERM "selected → active intern" onboarding tracker.
 * The tracker exposes a fixed 5-step pipeline with per-step statuses so
 * the frontend can render a stepper + a single "Next action" banner that
 * always tells the ERM where to look next.
 *
 * <p>The step IDs are part of the API contract — they're switched on in
 * the frontend to pick the right action component (modal launcher,
 * redirect link, waiting+reminder pair, gated activate button). Don't
 * rename them without coordinating with the frontend.</p>
 *
 * <p>The pipeline starts at "Assign documents" rather than "Offer sent".
 * Both offer-related steps were dropped: by the time a row appears in
 * the New Hire List, the offer is already SENT + SIGNED (that's the
 * entry condition for an InternLifecycle row to exist), so rendering
 * them as separate steps was just noise.</p>
