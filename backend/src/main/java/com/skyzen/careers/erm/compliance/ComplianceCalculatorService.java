 * ERM Phase 5 — pure business-day calculator for the Compliance Tracker.
 * Federal rules referenced here:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>I-9 Section 2: completed by the 3rd business day after the
 *       employee's first day of employment.</li>
 *   <li>E-Verify case: created by the 3rd business day after the first day

 *   <li>TNC contest window: 10 federal business days from FFS issuance.</li>

 * <p>Holidays are intentionally deferred — Mon-Fri arithmetic only. The
 * service is stateless so it composes cleanly inside other services + the
