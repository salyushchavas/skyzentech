 * {@link ErmOfferService#createAndSend} and the
 * {@code SelectionAckCard} emission in
 * {@code InternDashboardService.computeSelectionContext} — must read it
 * through this component, never inline.
 *
 * <p>Prior to extracting this policy the two surfaces diverged:
 * the gate keyed off the latest completed Interview's decision +
 * {@code Application.selectionAcknowledgedAt}, while the card added a
 * third guard requiring {@code User.lifecycleStatus == INTERVIEW_COMPLETED}.
 * That produced a deadlock for SELECTED interns whose lifecycle status
 * wasn't exactly INTERVIEW_COMPLETED — the offer 409'd, the card was
 * hidden, the intern had no way to acknowledge.</p>
