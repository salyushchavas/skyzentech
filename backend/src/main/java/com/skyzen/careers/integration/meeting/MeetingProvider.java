 * Provider-agnostic meeting integration surface. Both
 * {@link com.skyzen.careers.integration.zoom.ZoomService} and
 * {@link com.skyzen.careers.integration.webex.WebexService} implement this so
 * consumers can be migrated to a single typed seam, and the active
 * implementation is selected at runtime by the {@code MEETING_PROVIDER} env
 * variable (see {@link MeetingProviderConfig}).
 *
 * <p>Provider IDs are exposed as {@link String} on this interface even though
 * Zoom's API returns numeric {@code long} ids — keeping the interface
 * provider-agnostic means we don't need to widen DB columns until Phase 2 of
 * the migration. The Zoom adapter does the {@code long}↔{@link String}
 * conversion internally.</p>
 *
 * <p>The legacy {@code ZoomService} public Long-based methods are retained
 * unchanged; existing consumers continue to compile and run. Migration of
 * consumers to this interface is a separate phase that lands after the live
 * WebEx auth + meeting-create probes are verified.</p>
