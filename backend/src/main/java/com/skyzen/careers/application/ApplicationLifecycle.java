/**
 * Single source of truth for the application status lifecycle.
 *
 * Three things live here:
 *  - {@link #stageIndexOf(ApplicationStatus)} — the 5-stage stepper mapping
 *    (0 Applied → 1 Shortlisted → 2 Interview → 3 Offer → 4 Hired), with -1
 *    for exit statuses.
 *  - {@link #isExited(ApplicationStatus)} — whether the application has left
 *    the funnel (REJECTED / WITHDRAWN / LAPSED / NO_SHOW).
 *  - {@link #LEGAL_TRANSITIONS} — the gated state machine. Defined now,
 *    enforced in phase 1.1b. Existing write-sites are unaware of this table
 *    until then; same-state self-transitions are considered legal no-ops.
 *
 * NO behavior change in this commit: the two duplicated stageIndex helpers
 * in {@code CandidateDashboardService} + {@code CandidateApplicationsService}
 * — and their local EXIT_STATUSES sets — now delegate here.
