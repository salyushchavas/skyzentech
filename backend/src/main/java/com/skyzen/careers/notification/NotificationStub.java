/**
 * Facade around the wired {@link EmailProvider}. Delegates the actual send to
 * whichever provider was selected by {@link EmailProviderConfiguration} —
 * {@link SmtpEmailProvider} in prod, {@link LogEmailProvider} in dev /
 * unconfigured envs.
 *
 * <h2>History</h2>
 * Previously a concrete log-only stub (decision D2: "real send NOT wired");
 * also owned a {@code surface-stub} flag that echoed the verification code in
 * the registration HTTP response so the verify-email page could prefill it.
 * That field was a security hole — the code now rides email ONLY, never the
 * API. {@code surface-stub} is retired.
 *
 * <h2>Failure semantics</h2>
 * This class passes {@link EmailDeliveryException} through unchanged.
 * Callers decide:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Auth verification flows: catch + surface a retryable HTTP error
 *       (and let the @Transactional roll back).</li>
 *   <li>Post-verification "applicant ID issued" notice: best-effort —
 *       catching + logging keeps the verification successful.</li>
 *   <li>Password reset: best-effort — never reveal account existence.</li>
 *   <li>Recruiter conditional-selection: best-effort — selection itself is
 *       the source of truth.</li>
 * </ul>
